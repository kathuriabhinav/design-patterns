# Design Patterns

A collection of design pattern implementations in Java, focusing on practical examples and real-world use cases. Each pattern is implemented with a complete working example and detailed documentation.

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code. They help you:
- Write more maintainable and flexible code
- Solve common design problems
- Make your code more readable and understandable
- Avoid reinventing the wheel
